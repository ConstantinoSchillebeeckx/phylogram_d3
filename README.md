# phylogram_d3## DescriptionThis project is an adaptation of the [GitHubGist](https://gist.github.com/) created by [kueda](https://gist.github.com/kueda/1036776).  Given a Newick formatted file as well as a mappin file containing metadata, it is used to generate a rooted phylogenetic tree:> A phylogenetic tree or evolutionary tree is a branching diagram or "tree" showing the inferred evolutionary relationships among various biological species or other entities—their phylogeny—based upon similarities and differences in their physical or genetic characteristics. The taxa joined together in the tree are implied to have descended from a common ancestor.[- Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree#Unrooted_tree)## Dependencies[Twitter Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)[jQuery](https://jquery.com/)[Colorbrewer.js](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/5577023)[Newick.js](https://github.com/jasondavies/newick.js)[d3.js](https://d3js.org/)## Usage---Currently, the `init()` function is used to initialize the tree; the function takes three parameters:1. a string indicating the location of the Newick tree used to build the phylogram2. a string identifier for the div id into which to generate the phylogram, note that it must contain the '#' in it.  For example, if you want to render your tree in a div with the id 'phylogram' you'd pass '#phylogram' to the function and you'd need the following in your HTML: `<div id='phylogram'></div>`.3. an **optional** string indicating the location of the metadata mapping file for the tree.  This must be a TSV formatted file with the first column containing the same identifiers as those found in the Newick tree.  This file is used to generate the GUI which is used to change the styling of the tree.TODOAnimation: http://bl.ocks.org/d3noob/8375092
