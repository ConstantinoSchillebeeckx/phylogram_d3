# phylogram_d3This project is an adaptation of the [GitHubGist](https://gist.github.com/) created by [kueda](https://gist.github.com/kueda/1036776).  Given a Newick formatted file as well as a mapping file containing metadata, it is used to generate a rooted phylogenetic tree:> A phylogenetic tree or evolutionary tree is a branching diagram or "tree" showing the inferred evolutionary relationships among various biological species or other entities—their phylogeny—based upon similarities and differences in their physical or genetic characteristics. The taxa joined together in the tree are implied to have descended from a common ancestor.[- Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree#Unrooted_tree)## Dependencies[Twitter Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)[jQuery](https://jquery.com/)[Colorbrewer.js](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/5577023)[Newick.js](https://github.com/jasondavies/newick.js)[d3.js](https://d3js.org/)## UsageTo render the phylogram, you must provide a div (with an id) into which to render the tree, and you must call the initialization function `init()` to render the tree.  The `init()` function can simply be called in the `body` tag of your HTML page using the [onload](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/GlobalEventHandlers/onload) event handle; currently, the function takes three parameters:1. String indicating the location of the Newick tree used to build the phylogram.2. String identifier for the div id into which to generate the phylogram, note that it must contain the '#' in it.  For example, if you want to render your tree in a div with the id 'phylogram' you'd pass '#phylogram' to the function and you'd need the following in your HTML: `<div id='phylogram'></div>`.3. an **optional** string indicating the location of the metadata mapping file for the tree.  This must be a TSV formatted file with the first column containing the same identifiers as those found in the Newick tree.  If using taxaonomy data, format it in the QIIME default manner (e.g. *k__bacteria_2;p__firmicutes;c__negativicutes;o__selenomonadales;f__veillonellaceae;g__megasphaera;s__elsdenii*).  This file is used to generate the GUI which is used to change the styling of the tree.### Notes on the mapping file* must be a TSV with headers* first column values must be the same as the leaf nodes in the Newick tree* if providing taxonomy data, format it in the QIIME default manner (e.g. *k__bacteria_2;p__firmicutes;c__negativicutes;o__selenomonadales;f__veillonellaceae;g__megasphaera;s__elsdenii*).  If done correctly, this format will be parsed and cleaned up automatically* if using categorical data (e.g. GroupA, GroupB) the legend will render a row for every category value* if passing ordinal data (e.g. 0.4, 1.90) the legend will render a color bar with min/max values.  Therefore, if you have categorical data labeled with numbers (e.g. Site 1, 2, 3), ensure that you format the values with alphanumeric characters (e.g. Site1, Site2, Site3)A demo.php file has been provided to render the tree; furthermore, demo data can be found in the directory `/dat`
